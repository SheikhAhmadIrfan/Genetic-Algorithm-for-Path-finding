# Genetic Algorithm for Pathfinding

## Description

The Genetic Algorithm for Pathfinding is an implementation of a heuristic search algorithm inspired by natural selection and genetics. It efficiently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions to pathfinding problems in grids or graphs, considering obstacles or other constraints.

## Features

- Efficient pathfinding through heuristic search.
- Adaptability to various problem domains and search spaces.
- Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff for balancing exploration and exploitation of solutions.
- Robustness to noise and local optima.
- Potential for parallelization to speed up the search process.
